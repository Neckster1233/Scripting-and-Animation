// Random Placement Notes
// x form command to give x y z min and max
// Need a # of duplicates in the function
/* 
    Need to get selection first (ls -sl)
    It will be an array typically called $sels[] for "selections"
    for loop for # of duplicates so that it will run for each duplicate
    Need a nested for loop
    first loop cycles through each object listed
    second loop creates a duplicate for each object
    second loop index letter is typically j
    first loop condition i < size($sels)
    second loop condition j < numDups
    duplicate command and then needs to be assigned to a variable and should be for $sels[i]
    generate 3 random numbers inside the bounding box
    move it to that coordinate
    j++
    i++
